## Description üìù

> üëã **Welcome to this laboratory project!**
>
> üõ† **What is it?**  
> This is a modern web application built on the `JavaServer Faces` framework. Its architecture uses `2 facelets templates` for flexibility and modularity. The starting page provides general information and redirects to the main page with functionality. Server logic is implemented using `Managed Beans`, ensuring flexible and scalable data processing.
>
> üéØ **The goal of the site**  
> To make the process of entering coordinates of points and checking their hit in a given area as convenient and intuitive as possible. My `UI` was developed with a focus on good `UX` üòé
>
> ---
>
> üìå **Main features**
>
> - üñ• **Interactive Data Entry**: Use intuitive interface elements to enter coordinates.
> - üìä **Dynamic Graph**: Visualization of the area and points on the coordinate plane in real-time.
> - üîí **Server-Side Validation**: Reliable verification of entered data is ensured through Managed Beans.

## Technical Requirements

|![graph](resources/graph.png)|
|-----------------------------|

### Goal: Develop a web application based on the JavaServer Faces Framework

#### üìã Main parts of the application

- [x] `Managed Beans`: Managed beans that contain server-side data processing logic.
- [x] `index.xhtml`: The starting page containing general information and redirecting to the main page.
- [x] `main.xhtml`: The main application page with a web form for entering coordinates and displaying results.

#### üé® The `index.xhtml` start page should include

1. [x] Header: Full name, group number, variant number.
2. [x] Interactive Clock: Shows the current date and time, updates every 10 seconds.
3. [x] Link: allows you to go to the main page of the application.

#### üìä The main `main.xhtml` page should include

1. [x] A set of components: To set the coordinates of the point and the radius of the area according to the task variant. The use of additional component libraries may be required - [ICEfaces](http://www.icesoft.org/java/projects/ICEfaces/overview.jsf) (prefix "ace") and [PrimeFaces](http://www.primefaces.org/) (prefix "p").
    - [x] Form: Sends data to the server via Managed Beans.
    - [x] A set of fields: For setting the coordinates of the point and the radius of the area.
2. [x] Validation: JavaScript- or JSF-validation of entered data.
3. [x] üü† Interactive Element:
    - [x] Dynamic visualization of results on the graph.
    - [x] Graph update after each request.
    - [x] An adaptive graph that changes its state depending on the selected radius.
    - [x] The color of the points should depend on the fact of hitting/not hitting the area.
4. [x] Results: A table with the results of previous checks, stored in a Managed Bean.
5. [x] A link that allows you to return to the start page.

#### Additional requirements for the application:

- [x] All verification results must be stored in a PostgreSQL-managed database.
- [x] Access to the DB must use the ORM EclipseLink.
- [x] A Session-scoped Managed Bean should be used to manage the list of results.
- [x] The configuration of managed beans should be set using parameters in the configuration file.
- [x] The rules of navigation between the pages of the application should be defined in a separate configuration file.

#### üåê Deployment

- [x] The developed web application must be deployed on the `WildFly` server in standalone configuration, ports must be configured in accordance with the issued `portbase`, access to the http listener must be open to all IPs.

## Topics for preparation for laboratory defense

1. [x] `JavaServer Faces` technology. Features, differences from `servlets` and `JSP`, advantages and disadvantages. Structure of a JSF application.
2. [x] Using `JSP pages` and `Facelets templates` in JSF applications.
3. [x] `JSF components` - implementation features, class hierarchy. Additional component libraries. The `event processing model` in JSF applications.
4. [x] Data converters and validators.
5. [x] Presentation of the `JSF` page on the `server side`. UIViewRoot class.
6. [x] `Managed beans` - purpose, configuration methods. Managed beans context.
7. [x] Configuration of JSF applications. The faces-config.xml file. FacesServlet class.
8. [x] Navigation in JSF applications.
9. [x] Access to the DB from Java applications. `JDBC` protocol, query formation, working with DBMS drivers.
10. [x] `ORM concept`. ORM libraries in Java applications. Main APIs. Integration of ORM providers with JDBC drivers.
11. [x] ORM libraries `Hibernate` and `EclipseLink`. Features, API, similarities and differences.
12. [x] `JPA technology`. Features, API, integration with ORM providers.

## How to use my project

### Docker

> [!TIP]
> For a quick setup to view the project (not suitable for profiling for the OPI course and Docker is not available on Helios)

```bash
git clone git@github.com:worthant/interactive-graph-ui.git
cd interactive-graph-ui
mvn clean package
docker-compose up --build
```

Connect in browser:

```bash
http://localhost:32318/interactive-graph-ui-1.0-SNAPSHOT/
```

### Manual setup (for helios mainly)

> [!NOTE]
> I've included a fully functional standalone.xml config in the resources - you can check it out as an example and use it for the project.

1. Follow all the steps from [my guide](https://github.com/worthant/web3-jsf-eclipselink-template/)
2. Don't forget to create a database in studs:

> Connect with `psql -h pg -d studs`

```sql
CREATE TABLE point_model {
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  x DOUBLE PRECISION NOT NULL,
  y DOUBLE PRECISION NOT NULL,
  r DOUBLE PRECISION NOT NULL
}
```

3. Also, don't forget to forward the ports:

```bash
ssh -L port:localhost:port sXXXXXX@se.ifmo.ru -p 2222
```

4. Done, go to the browser and enter:

```bash
http://localhost:port/interactive-graph-ui-1.0-SNAPSHOT/
```
